Event Summary
What made your hackathon special or unique?
HACK.COMS is a vibrant hackathon that highlights the computing talent of underrepresented students. Over an intensive period, participants collaborate to develop innovative software solutions, whether an app, website, game, or other digital creation. This experience provides students invaluable opportunities to interact with company sponsors and experienced mentors who offer guidance and support throughout the project development process. Alongside the coding challenges, participants can enjoy engaging tech talks and activities that encourage creativity, teamwork, and personal growth.
Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on.
This year at HACK.COMS we featured 7 different workshops and 8 different fun events for our hackers to enjoy. These workshops were put on by various groups across our RIT campus. Our fun events were also put on as a way for our hackers to destress and have fun while in the midst of their creation process. 
How was GitHub featured at your event?
